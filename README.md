<h1 align="center"> Bulldozers Price Detector ðŸšœ</h1> 

In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

<H3>1. Problem defition</H3>
How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

<H3>2. Data</H3>
The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

There are 3 main datasets:

   * Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
   * Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
   * Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.

<H3>3. Evaluation</H3>

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation

Note: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.

<H3>4. Features</H3>
Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset. You can view this data dictionary on Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ly-bLR8sbDJLITkWG7ozKm8l3RyieQ2Fpgix-beSYI/edit?usp=sharing
